# Concepts

## Process management

Process management on IntelMQ has two modes on this proposal: systemd and PID.\
Changing on IntelMQ configuration the process management to PID will work as always worked before. Using systemd to do process management will rely on systemd to manage the IntelMQ.

**on defaults configuration:**
```
{
    ...
    "process_manager": "< pid / systemd >"
    ...
}
```

## Status

An bot configured with `status: enable` will be allowed to start using `intelmqctl` command. If bot is configured with `status: disable`, the bot will not be allowed to start in any way. This functionality is useful for bots that are not working properly, therefore cannot be start unless the status changes by sysadmin.

```
    "abusech-domain-parser": {
        ...
        "parameters": {
            "status": "enable"
        }
    }
```

## Onboot

An IntelMQ bot configured with onboot enabled will start automatically when operating system starts.

```
    "abusech-domain-parser": {
        ...
        "parameters": {
            "onboot": true
        }
    }
```

## Run mode

Each bot can be configured with a specific run mode such as:
* **continuous:** bot will run and process messages indefinitely.
* **scheduled:** bot will start at the defined `schedule_time`, run one successfully time and then exit.

**on runtime configuration:**
```
    "abusech-domain-parser": {
        ...
        "parameters": {
            "run_mode": "< continuous / scheduled >"
        }
    }
```

**Schedule time parameter clarification:**
`schedule_time` is a parameter defined per each bot on runtime configuration which specify the scheduled time when the bot should run. This parameter needs to be defined using crontab syntax. Please note that this parameter is only applicable to bots configured as `scheduled` run_mode.



## Run Modes with Process Management

## Configurations (admin vs internal)

In a quick overview, admin configurations are the usual configurations that the sysadmin has access and use to configure IntelMQ and the bots and internal configurations are the configurations generated by the changes applied by sysadmin during his actions. The main reason for this is because there is a need to keep the current and successfull state of the bots even if sysadmin change something wrongly which can put IntelMQ in an unstable situation. There are multiple scenarios to proof this but for the sake of the simplicity in this proposal, we only say that admin configurations are the usual ones and internal configurations will be a stable copy handled automatically by intelmqctl without any interaction by sysadmin. Knowing that internal configurations MUST only be changed by intelmqctl, not manually, these configuration files will be placed in files located on `/var/run/intelmq`.

In a nutshell, intelmqctl will always have a copy of the three main configuration files (runtime.conf, defaults.conf and pipeline.conf) and will use them to detect possible issues, such as, bots which are running but not being managed since they were removed manually from configuration files.

**Technical Information (only for implementation clarification purposes):** In situations where intelmqctl detects some insconsitence between the internal configurations (which have the current running state) and the admin configurations, intelmqctl will require action from sysadmin. Also, in case intelmqctl is NOT being run on interactive mode, will be available the possibility to specify flags to automatically perform the actions without need interaction. Regarding the check procedure in order to detect the inconsistencies, intelmqctl will always perform the normal checks between internal runtime configuration and admin runtime configuration for all bots even if the `intelmqctl` command was executed just to only one bot. This checks will allow the sysadmin to be aware that something is wrong with the configuration even if sysadmin is executing other command with intelmqctl, therefore, a warning message will always show in the end of the command output.


# intelmqctl

**Rules & Checks:**
* the sysadmin in order to remove a bot from the configuration which is still running. MUST first to stop and then remove the configuration, not the opposite.
* will always execute the bot background, not in foreground.
* will always provide the best log message in order to give additional information to sysadmin about the actions performed. 
* will always check if there is any issue with configurations (runtime, defaults, pipeline) regarding all bots even if just one action to one bot has been executed.
 * in case a bot is running but some configuration for that bot is missing in one of the files, the action will not be performed and sysadmin will receive a warning message
 * intelmqctl will automatically re-add the missing configuration and ask to syadmin to re-run the command again, now with the configurations cleaned.


**Syntax:**
```
intelmqctl <action command> <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Flags:**

* `--now`: this parameter will execute the bot automatically without taking into account `run_mode`.
* `--debug`: this parameter will execute the bot in debug mode which automatically run it in foreground in order to easily see the log lines in the console and the log level will also automatically set up to `DEBUG`.
* `--filter`: this parameter will provide to sysadmin a quick way to apply a filter to which bots the action will take place. The filtering can be done using the configuration parameters as the following example:
```
intelmqctl start --filter "run_mode:scheduled, group:Collectors"
```


## intelmqctl start action

**Command:**

```
intelmqctl start <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` will not perform any action to a bot which is already running.
* if Run mode: continuous
  - if Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will check if there is a PID file
    - if PID file exists, do nothing
    - if PID file does not exist, execute start action on bot and write PID file
  - if Process manager: systemd
    - execute `systemctl start <module@bot_id>`
* if Run mode: scheduled
  - if Process manager: PID or systemd
    - intelmqctl will check if crontab configuration line for the bot is already on crontab:
     - if crontab configuration line exists, do nothing. In the end, write a log message "bot is already running"
     - if crontab configuration line does not exists, add configuration line on crontab such as `<schedule_time> <intelmq bot module> <bot_id> # <bot_id>`. In the end, write a log message "bot is schedule and will run at this time: `* * * * * `"


## intelmqctl stop action

**Command:**

```
intelmqct stop <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` will not perform any action to a bot which is already stopped.
* if Run mode: continuous
  - if Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will check if there is a PID file
    - if PID file exists, execute stop action on the bot and remove PID file
    - if PID file does not exist, do nothing
  - if Process manager: systemd
    - execute `systemctl stop <module@bot_id>`
* if Run mode: scheduled
  - if Process manager: PID or systemd
    - intelmqctl will check if crontab configuration line for the bot is still on crontab
    - if crontab configuration line exists, remove configuration line on crontab. In the end, write a log message "bot is unschedule."
    - if crontab configuration line does not exists, do nothing. In the end, write a log message "bot is already stopped"


## intelmqctl restart action

**Command:**

```
intelmqctl restart <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` will use the stop action command and start action command to perform the restart, therefore, there is no additional information required here, is only to actions commands being executed already explained.



## intelmqctl reload action

**Command:**

```
intelmqctl reload <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` will perform additional checks in order to handle some issues related to correct procedures which may not being followed by admin. The checks will be described in this section. 

* if `<bot_id>` has a new `run_mode` value AND `<bot_id>` is running:
  - raise message "`<bot_id>` is configured with a new `run_mode` therefore cannot be reload and it requires to be restarted in order to reload the new configuration. Do you want to restart the bot to apply the new `run_mode`? [Y/n]"
    - "[Y] `intelmqctl` will automatically execute restart action on the bot and the bot will start with the new configuration" \
    - "[N] `intelmqctl` will not perform any action, therefore bot will keep running in the current run state.
* else:
  * Run mode: continuous
    - Process manager: PID
      - intelmqctl will check if there is a PID file
      - if PID file exists, execute reload action on the bot
      - if PID file does not exist, do nothing
    - Process manager: systemd
      - execute `systemctl reload <module@bot_id>` (this action will be automatically specified in systemd template service file)
  * Run mode: scheduled
    - Process manager: PID or systemd
      - intelmqctl will check if crontab configuration line for the bot is still on crontab:
        - if crontab configuration line exists, replate it and log a message explaining the update action.
        - if crontab configuration line does not exists, add it and log a message explaining the update action.
      **Note**: if a scheduled bot is running the reload action will be ignored until the next bot execution.

**Please note** the above explanation is exemplifying an interactive mode of intelmqctl, however, there will be available additional parameters to automatically answer the questions which will allow to execute this command by scripts or other tools.


## intelmqctl configtest action

**Command:**
```
intelmqctl configtest <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* there are 2 types of checks. check if json is ok and check if parameters of bots are ok.
 * for json check should give a generic message in case of something is failing saying "json is bad"
 * for bot check should give a generic message in case of something is failing saying "bot config is bad because ..."


## intelmqctl status action

**Command:**
```
intelctl status <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* Run mode: continuous
  - Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will check if there is a PID file
      - if PID file exists, log message saying the current status is "running"
      - if PID file does not exists, log message saying the current status is "not running"
  - Process manager: systemd
    - execute `systemctl status <module@bot_id>`
* Run mode: scheduled
  - Process manager: PID or systemd
    - intelmqctl will check if bot is configured on crontab
      - if configured on crontab, log message saying the current status is "running"
      - if not configured on crontab, log message saying the current status is "not running"

**Ouput Proposal Example 1:**

| bot_id    | run_mode    | scheduled_time (if applicable) | status             | enabled_on_boot | configtest   |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| my-bot-1  | continuous      | -                              | running            | yes             | valid        |

Also intelmqctl should print the last 10 log lines from the log of this bot.

**Ouput Proposal Example 2:**

| bot_id    | run_mode    | scheduled_time (if applicable) | status             | enabled_on_boot | configtest   |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| my-bot-2  | scheduled   | 1 * * * *                      | running (unstable) | no              | invalid      |

Also intelmqctl should print the last 10 log lines from the log of this bot.


## intelmqctl enable action

**Command:**
```
intelctl enable <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` perform the usual checks and if no errors found, `intelmqctl` will configure the runtime configuration for the <bot_id> accordingly to the following procedure:

* Run mode: continuous
  - Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will not perform any action and will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
    - In the end, write a log message "IntelMQ does not support onboot configuration in PID process management. Please use systemd process management"
  - Process manager: systemd
    - execute `systemctl enable <module@bot_id>`
    - intelmqctl will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `true` value.
* Run mode: scheduled
  - Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will not perform any action and will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
    - In the end, write a log message "IntelMQ does not support onboot configuration in PID process management. Please use systemd process management"
  - Process manager: systemd
    - intelmqctl will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `true` value.
    - intelmqctl will not perform any other action because there is a `intelmq.scheduled_bots_on_boot.service` which is always enable and will automatically write the crontab configuration accordingly to the all bots configured as `run_mode: scheduled` and `onboot: true`, therefore will write on crontab configuration the correct crontab entry to this bot enabled onboot. For more information please read "Run Modes with Process Management concept" section.


## intelmqctl disable action

**Command:**
```
intelctl disable <bot_id> <flags>
```

**Procedure:**

* `intelmqctl` perform the usual checks and if no errors found, `intelmqctl` will configure the runtime configuration for the <bot_id> accordingly to the following procedure:

* Run mode: continuous
  - Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will not perform any action and will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
    - In the end, write a log message "IntelMQ does not support onboot configuration in PID process management. Please use systemd process management"
  - Process manager: systemd
    - execute `systemctl disable <module@bot_id>`
    - intelmqctl will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
* Run mode: scheduled
  - Process manager: PID
    - intelmqctl will not perform any action and will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
    - In the end, write a log message "IntelMQ does not support onboot configuration in PID process management. Please use systemd process management"
  - Process manager: systemd
    - intelmqctl will change `onboot` configuration parameter to `false` value.
    - intelmqctl will not perform any other action because there is a `intelmq.scheduled_bots_on_boot.service` which is always enable and will automatically write the crontab configuration accordingly to the all bots configured as `run_mode: scheduled` and `onboot: true`, therefore will not write on crontab configuration anything related to this bot disabled onboot. For more information please read "Run Modes with Process Management concept" section.



# Scenarios (DEPRECATED)

## Scenario 1

**Scenario:** botnet start command after bot configuration was manually removed

Please note that this scenario is using botnet commands, therefore, it's crutial to have a good understand about botnet concept. Also, every single mentioned to "bots", except mentioned explicity, means bots which are part of the botnet.

1. In this case there are 10 bots configured as `botnet: true`. Admin execute the command to start the botnet.
2. Admin accidentally remove manually a bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1` from admin runtime configuration without stopping it previously.
3. Admin add manually a new bot with `bot_id: my-bot-2` to admin runtime configuration.
4. Admin execute the command to start the botnet which will do the following:
 1. do nothing to the bots which were already started in the first execution of the command to start the botnet
 2. execute start command following normal procedure to the `bot_id: my-bot-2` and intelmqctl will update the internal runtime configuration accordingly.
 3. keep the bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1` running but will also add the configuration stored in internal runtime configuration to the admin runtime configuration in order to prevent possible loss of bot configuration by this user mistake (not following the correct procedure).
 4. log a warning message providing information to the admin explaining the situation: "intelmqctl detected that bot my-bot-1 is still running but has been removed from user runtime configuration. intelmqctl added it to the user runtime configuration. Please first stop the bot, and remove it afterwards.".

The **correct procedure** is stop bot first and then remove bot configuration from admin runtime configuration.

## Scenario 2

**Scenario:** botnet stop command after bot configuration was manually removed

Please note that this scenario is using botnet commands, therefore, it's crutial to have a good understand about botnet concept. Also, every single mentioned to "bots", except mentioned explicity, means bots which are part of the botnet.

1. In this case there are 10 bots configured as `botnet: True`. Admin execute the command to start the botnet.
2. Admin accidentally remove manually a bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1` from admin runtime configuration without stopping it previously.
3. Admin execute the command stop one of the bots with `bot_id: my-bot-2` already configured bot in runtime configuration.
5. Admin change manually a completely new admin runtime configuration to the bot with `bot_id: my-bot-3` which was already configured with other configuration parameters.
6. Admin execute the command to stop the botnet which will do the following:
 1. do nothing to the bots which were already stopped, in this specific scenario, nothing will perform to the bot with `bot_id: my-bot-2`
 2. do nothing to the bots which never started, in this specific scenario, nothing will perform to the new bot with `bot_id: my-bot-3` which was only added to the admin runtime configuration steps before.
 2. execute stop command following normal procedure to all configured bots on admin runtime configuration which are still running, in this scenario, this action will not be applicable to the bots: `bot_id: my-bot-1`, `bot_id: my-bot-2` and `bot_id: my-bot-3`.
 3. execute stop command to the bot `bot_id: my-bot-1` and also add the configuration stored in internal runtime configuration to the admin runtime configuration in order to prevent possible loss of bot configuration by this user mistake (not following the correct procedure).
 4. log a warning message providing information to the admin explaining the situation: "intelmqctl detected that bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1` is was running but has been removed from admin runtime configuration. intelmqctl stopped it and added it to the admin runtime configuration. Please first stop the bot, and remove it afterwards.".

The **correct procedure** is stop bot first and then remove bot configuration from admin runtime configuration.


## Scenario 3

**Scenario:** botnet reload command after bot configuration was manually removed

Please note that this scenario is using botnet commands, therefore, it's crutial to have a good understand about botnet concept. Also, every single mentioned to "bots", except mentioned explicity, means bots which are part of the botnet.

1. In this case there are 10 bots configured as `botnet: True`. Admin execute the command to start the botnet.
2. Admin execute the command to stop a bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1`.
3. Admin accidentally remove manually a bot with `bot_id: my-bot-2` from admin runtime configuration without stopping it previously.
4. Admin execute the command to reload the botnet which will do the following:
 1. do nothing to the bots which are stopped, in this specific scenario, nothing will perform to the bot with `bot_id: my-bot-1`
 2. execute reload command following normal procedure to all configured bots on admin runtime configuration which are still running, in this specific scenario, will perform to all bots except the bots with `bot_id: my-bot-1` and `bot_id: my-bot-2`.
 3. log a warning message providing information to the admin explaining the situation: "intelmqct detected that bot with `bot_id: my-bot-2` is still running but has been removed from admin runtime configuration."
 4. in interactive mode, intelmqctl will ask the following question: "Do you want to stop the bot with `bot_id: my-bot-2`? [N/y]"

  * if "Y", intelmqctl remove the bot configuration from runtime configuration (internal and admin configurations) and also check in all IntelMQ system if there is some additional internal configurations that are still having configured that bot.
  * if "N", intelmqctl add the bot configuration stored in internal runtime configuration to the admin runtime configuration in order to keep the admin runtime configuration up to date accordingly.

The **correct procedure** is stop bot first and then remove bot configuration from admin runtime configuration.





# Discuss with Aaron

* missing concept: every bot MUST have a self-test and stats-component. This can be used for the ctl tool to check if the internal state of a bot is OK.
